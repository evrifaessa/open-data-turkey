# :tr: Open data index of Turkey
[A comprehensive open data index of Turkey](https://github.com/evrifaessa/open-data-turkey). This repository lists open data portals made public by municipal governments and the government of Turkey.

### Why?
Turkey definitely needs some improvement on transparency. As developers and citizens, we often have a hard time finding decent data about our country. I listed the resources I could find to make this already difficult process a little easier. Please contribute to this list.


If you are a citizen, please encourage state and municipal organizations to publish data that should be ours.
